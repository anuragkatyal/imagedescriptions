The image shows a graph of a quadratic function, illustrating a parabola centered at the origin within a Cartesian coordinate system. This visualization is used to explain the properties of quadratic functions in a pretext book.

### Description of the Graph:
- **Axes**: The graph includes two axes:
  - \( x \)-axis extending horizontally from -3 to 5.
  - \( y \)-axis extending vertically from -4 to 3.
- **Grid**: The background consists of a grid with square cells, each representing one unit along the \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. This helps in accurately locating points on the graph.
- **Quadratic Curve**:
  - The curve is a parabola opening upwards, shown in red.
  - The vertex of the parabola is at the point (0, -3), which is the lowest point on the curve.
  - The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line passing through the vertex.

### Detailed Path Description:
- **Shape of the Parabola**:
  - The parabola starts at the top left of the graph, decreases as it approaches the vertex, and then increases symmetrically on the right side.
  - As the \( x \) values move away from the vertex in either direction, the \( y \) values increase.
- **Points on the Curve**:
  - At \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 2 \), the \( y \)-values are 1.
  - At \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \), the \( y \)-values are -2.
  - The vertex is at (0, -3).

### Mathematical Representation:
- The quadratic function represented by this parabola can be written in the standard form:
  \[
  y = (x - 1)^2 - 4
  \]
  This equation indicates that for every value of \( x \), the value of \( y \) is determined by the squared distance from \( x \) to 1, adjusted by -4.

This graph visually demonstrates the basic shape and properties of a quadratic function, showing how the function forms a parabola with its vertex at the origin and opening upwards. It helps in understanding the relationship between the \( x \) and \( y \) values for a quadratic equation.
